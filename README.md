- The rule name is the unique identifier. As the rule names can duplicate. The script exits if there are more than 1 rule with same name.
- `addRule` inserts the rule after/before a reference rule. 
- `replaceRule` replaces the rule based on a rulename.
- The name of the rules file to be inserted or replaced is configurable, but the file containing the rule should be placed under `samplerules` folder.
